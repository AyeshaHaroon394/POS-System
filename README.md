# POS-System
The Pharmacy Point of Sale (POS) System is a desktop application developed in Java
Swing, designed to streamline the sales and inventory management processes of a
pharmacy. This POS system will provide an efficient and user-friendly platform for
pharmacists and staff to manage customer transactions, track inventory, and generate
reports.
The primary goals of this project are to enhance the efficiency of pharmacy operations,
improve inventory tracking and management, and ensure a good user experience. The
system aims to develop a user-friendly application for pharmacy staff to handle day to
day transactions and address customer needs speedily, avoiding long wait-times.
